QSAR-Based Prediction of Antioxidant Activity in Cannabaceae-Derived Molecules

---
## Overview
This repository hosts machine learning–based QSAR models designed to predict the antioxidant activity of natural compounds, with a particular focus on metabolites derived from the **Cannabaceae** family.

The models were constructed using curated experimental IC₅₀ data, molecular descriptors, and advanced feature selection strategies to elucidate structure–activity relationships relevant to antioxidant mechanisms.

## Data Set Description 
- **Data sources:** ChEMBL (v35) and PubChem BioAssay
- **Initial dataset:** 24,394 compounds
- **Curated dataset:**
  - 15,026 molecules with IC₅₀ values
- Units standardized to **nM**

## Model Performance (Internal Validation)
The predictive performance of the developed QSAR models was evaluated using internal validation metrics, including the coefficient of determination (R²) and the root mean squared error (RMSE).

The trained model artifacts are available in the [`models/`](models/) directory.
